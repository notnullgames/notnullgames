<Callout emoji='ðŸ˜ƒ'>Javascript is a fun & simple language, that is very easy to prototype ideas with. It's interpreted, so you are trading it's simplicity for the added size in your cart.</Callout>

- See [cart structure](/null0/cart) for more info about how callbacks work.
- See [API](/null0/api) for more info about the null0 API.
- See [examples](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/js)
- WASI is exposed, and [std](https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html#std-module) and [os](https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html#os-module) are available
- Check out the [JS template project](https://github.com/notnullgames/cart_js]
- Your code is interpreted with [quickjs](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) compiled as a cart (full WASI & null0 API is available & global.)
- Include [main.wasm](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/js/main.wasm) in your cart-zip, along with any assets you are using, and make a `main.js`.

A simple cart might look like this:

<Example src='js/example/main.js' />

Which looks like this:

<Null0Cart src='/carts/js-example.null0' />

And then you can compile to a cart with:

```sh
mkdir -p cart
curl https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/js/main.wasm > cart/main.wasm
cp *.js cart
cd cart
zip -rq ../mygame.null0 .
```

See [build.sh](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/build.sh) for an example of how I build for this example-site.

For `zip` command, you can skip packaging some files (like `.DS_Store`) with `-x ".DS_Store" "__*"` (after all the other options.)

If you want a similar language, but with more efficient cart-code, maybe try out [assemblyscript](assemblyscript). It's not exacly the same, and a bit less "loose", but the syntax is pretty similar, and it doesn't need to include the entire quickjs interpretor in your wasm, so it creates a smaller & more efficient cart.
