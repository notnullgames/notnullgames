<Callout>
Nim is a fun language that compiles to C (or C++, or a few more.) It feels a little like python or lua.
</Callout>

You can read more [on the nim website](https://nim-lang.org/). You will need [nim installed](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) to use it.

Here is some example code:

#### src/main.nim
```nim
proc load() {.null0.} =
  echo "Hello from justlog."

proc unload() {.null0.} =
  echo "Ok, bye."
```

### easy build

If you use [our template](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0-cart-nim) or the [CLI quick-starter](../quick), it's a bit easier to get started quickly:

```
nimble cart
```

### manual build

For null0, you need to import [the header](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/blob/main/src/carts/null0.nim), and you will get the `{.null0.}` pragma and some null0 functions and constants.

To compile to the correct wasm, you can use [this config](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/blob/main/src/carts/config.nims), which sets some flags and imports [the header](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/blob/main/src/carts/null0.nim).

```
nimble install https://github.com/notnullgames/null0-nim
cd src
nim c main.nim
```

This will create `main.wasm`, so now you can create a zip file:

```
zip ../mycart.null0 -r main.wasm assets/
```

### docker

If you have docker installed, you can use it to build, without needing to install anything else (no nim, etc.)

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/cart konsumer/null0:nim nimble cart
```
