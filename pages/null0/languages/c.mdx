- See [cart structure](/null0/cart) for more info about how callbacks work.
- See [API](/null0/api) for more info about the null0 API.
- See [examples](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/c)
- You can use WASI too, so all regular C stdlib-file stuff should work.

For building carts in C, if you want to get the most out of null0, you should install [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk). It will expose important WASI things (files, stdio, etc) and makes it easier to compile "regular" C code. Put [null0.h](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/blob/main/carts/null0.h) in your include-path (or just in the same dir) and it should work great. Although emscripten and plain clang can also build your main.wasm, it requires some CLI flags, and you will not have access to lower-level WASI stuff, without some trickery.

A simple cart might look like this:

<Example src='c/circle/main.c' />

<null0-cart src="/carts/c-circle.null0"></null0-cart>

And then you can compile to a cart with:

```shell
mkdir -p cart
/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang main.c -o cart/main.wasm
cd cart
zip -rq ../mygame.null0 .
```

Anything in the zip-file is available in WASI filesystem, or any of the [null0 api](/null0/api), so if you have `cart/logo.png`, and you want to draw it in the middle of the screen, do this:

<Example src='c/logo/main.c' />

That looks like this:

<null0-cart src="/carts/c-logo.null0"></null0-cart>
