<Callout emoji='âš¡'>C is a powerful and straight-forward language, and using it in null0 is highly recommended.</Callout>

- See [cart structure](/null0/cart) for more info about how callbacks work.
- See [API](/null0/api) for more info about the null0 API.
- See [examples](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/c)
- You can use WASI too, so all regular C stdlib-file stuff should work.
- Check out the [C template project](https://github.com/notnullgames/cart_c)
- You will need [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) installed.
- The definitive header is [here](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/blob/main/carts/c/null0.h), so use that to ensure yours is up-to-date

A simple cart might look like this:

<Example src='c/circle/main.c' />

<Null0Cart src='/carts/c-circle.null0' />

And then you can compile to a cart with:

```shell
mkdir -p cart
/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang main.c -o cart/main.wasm
cd cart
zip -rq ../mygame.null0 .
```

See [build.sh](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/build.sh) for an example of how I build for this example-site.

For `clang` command, you can use `-I WHEREVER_NULL0_H_IS` if null0.h is in another directory.

For `zip` command, you can skip packaging some files (like `.DS_Store` and `*.c`) with `-x ".DS_Store" "__*" "*.c" "*.h"` (after all the other options.)

Anything in the zip-file is available in WASI filesystem, or any of the [null0 api](/null0/api), so if you have `cart/logo.png`, and you want to draw it in the middle of the screen, do this:

<Example src='c/logo/main.c' />

That looks like this:

<Null0Cart src='/carts/c-logo.null0' />
