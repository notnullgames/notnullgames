import Callout from '@/Callout'

<Callout emoji='A'>[Assemblyscript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) is pretty much typescript, with some builtin-types for WASM. It's a great choice, if you are already familiar with javascirpt or typescript.</Callout>

- See [cart structure](/null0/cart) for more info about how callbacks work.
- See [API](/null0/api) for more info about the null0 API.
- See [examples](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/)
- You can use WASI too, so you can use [as-wasi](https://github.com/jedisct1/as-wasi)

### TODO

I have not made a header/library for this language, but it is technically workable. The host will export [null0 api](/null0/api) as well as WASI-preview1. I could [use help](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0)!
