import Callout from '@/Callout'

<Callout emoji='🐍'>[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a fun & simple language, that is very easy to prototype ideas with. Normally, it's interpreted which adds some cart-size, but we compile to minimal wasm.</Callout>

- See [cart structure](/null0/cart) for more info about how callbacks work.
- See [API](/null0/api) for more info about the null0 API.
- See [examples](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/)
- You can use WASI too, so you can use regular file-stuff

<Callout emoji='☠️' className='alert-soft alert-warning'>
  I have not made a header/library for this language, but it is technically workable. The host will export [null0 api](/null0/api) as well as WASI-preview1. I could [use help](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0)!
