The idea with graphics is that everything is an "image" and the screen is image `0`. <br/>
You can draw any image on another image, and you can draw shapes & gradients on images.
</Callout>


Here are some examples:

<Cart cart='/draw.null0' />

<Cart cart='/fonts.null0' />

Source: [draw](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/tree/main/src/carts/draw) | [fonts](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/tree/main/src/carts/fonts)


The null0 zip-file looks like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ logo.png
â””â”€â”€ main.wasm
```


Our docs aren't really ready, but we're working on it.

Here is the nim signatures for now:

```nim
# create a new image
proc create_image(width: uint32, height:uint32): uint32

# load an image from file inside the cart
proc load_image(filename: string): uint32

# load a BM font from file inside the cart (image with seperator color)
proc load_font_bm(filename: string, chars: string): uint32

# load a TTY font from file inside the cart (fixed-width image)
proc load_font_tty(filename: string, glyphWidth: int, glyphHeight: int, chars: string): uint32

# load a TTF font from file inside the cart
proc load_font_ttf(filename: string, fontSize: int, fontColor: Color): uint32

# clear screen
proc clear_background(color: Color)

# draw a circle on screen
proc draw_circle(centerX: int, centerY: int, radius:int, color: Color)

# draw a pixel on screen
proc draw_pixel(x: int, y: int, color: Color)

# draw a line on screen
proc draw_line(startPosX: int, startPosY: int, endPosX: int, endPosY: int, color: Color)

# draw a rectangle on screen
proc draw_rectangle(posX: int, posY: int, width: int, height: int, color: Color)

# draw a round-rectangle on screen
proc draw_round_rectangle(posX: int, posY: int, width: int, height: int, radius: int, color: Color)

# draw an elipse on screen
proc draw_ellipse(posX: int, posY: int, width: int, height: int, radiusX:int, radiusY:int, color: Color)

# draw an image on screen
proc draw_image(src: uint32, posX: int, posY: int)

# draw text on screen
proc draw_text(font: uint32, text: string, posX: int, posY: int)

# fill screen with a vertical gradient
proc gradient_vertical(width: int, height: int, top: Color, bottom: Color)

# fill screen with a horizontal gradient
proc gradient_horizontal(width: int, height: int, left: Color, right: Color)
```

In languages that can use overloads, like nim, you can also set first param to `destination` for an image, and 0 is "screen" in all things that use an image. This means that you can copy a part of the screen to an image, or draw on an image, instead of the screen.

In C, and other languages that do not do overloads, you can add `_on_image` to the end of the name, like this:

```nim
# clear image
proc clear_background_on_image(destination: uint32, color: Color)

# draw a circle on image
proc draw_circle_on_image(destination: uint32, centerX: int, centerY: int, radius:int, color: Color)

# draw a pixel on image
proc draw_pixel_on_image(destination: uint32, x: int, y: int, color: Color)

# draw a line on image
proc draw_line_on_image(destination: uint32, startPosX: int, startPosY: int, endPosX: int, endPosY: int, color: Color)

# draw a rectangle on image
proc draw_rectangle_on_image(destination: uint32, posX: int, posY: int, width: int, height: int, color: Color)

# draw a round-rectangle on image
proc draw_round_rectangle_on_image(destination: uint32, posX: int, posY: int, width: int, height: int, radius: int, color: Color)

# draw an elipse on image
proc draw_ellipse_on_image(destination: uint32, posX: int, posY: int, width: int, height: int, radiusX:int, radiusY:int, color: Color)

# draw an image on image
proc draw_image_on_image(destination: uint32, src: uint32, posX: int, posY: int)

# draw text on image
proc draw_text_on_image(destination: uint32, font: uint32, text: string, posX: int, posY: int)

# fill image with a vertical gradient
proc gradient_vertical_on_image(destination: uint32, width: int, height: int, top: Color, bottom: Color)

# fill image with a horizontal gradient
proc gradient_horizontal_on_image(destination: uint32, width: int, height: int, left: Color, right: Color)
```

You can also add `_outline` to all drawing-functions, to draw a 1-pixel outline instead of filling it.


```nim
# draw outlined circle on screen
proc draw_circle_outline(destination: uint32, centerX: int, centerY: int, radius:int, color: Color)

# draw outlined circle on image
proc draw_circle_outline_on_image(destination: uint32, centerX: int, centerY: int, radius:int, color: Color)
```
