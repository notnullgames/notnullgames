Null0 is an easy & fun 2D game-engine that lets you write your game in many languages.<br/>
It's fun to use, and a great way to learn new programming languages.
</Callout>

The basic idea is that you make your game in whatever language you like, and put that with your assets in a zip-file, and you can run it in libretro, or the standalone runtime, or on the web.

### supported

We currently fully support these languages:

- [Nim](/null0/languages/nim)
- [C / C++](/null0/languages/c)

### planned

These are planned:

- [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)
- [C3](https://c3-lang.org/)
- [D](https://dlang.org/)
- [Go](https://tinygo.org/)
- [Lua](https://nelua.io/)
- [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)
- [Roland](https://github.com/DenialAdams/roland)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [WebAssembly Text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format)
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

### concepts

#### types

- `u32`, `u16`, `u8` - "unsigned integer" each is a specific bit-size (8 bits in a byte.) These are integers that are only positive or 0.
- `i32`, `i16`, `i8` - "signed integer" each is a specific bit-size (8 bits in a byte.) These are integers that are positive/negative or 0.
- `string` - this is `char*` in C. It's a standard "C-string", which is a pointer to bytes that are UTF8/null-terminated. Effort will be made to wrap them in cart-languages, to make them make more sense.
- `struct` - this is some bytes that describe a kind of object, with fields. There are a few things that return these, and they are the same as in C. Effort will be made to wrap them in cart-languages, to make them make more sense.
- All resources (images, fonts, sounds, etc) are `u32` reference-counters.

### contribution

<Callout emoji="❤️">
You can use any language that compiles to wasm, so if you like a language we are missing, consider making a language-idiomatic header/demo-project for your favorite language, and sending us a [PR](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/pulls).
</Callout>

The plan is to have a complete template-project for any cart-language, so it's easy for people to get started with their preferred ecosystem.

#### notes

- With many things, there may be a more idiomatic way to do it, in that language (like in C/nim, reading/writing files) but we currently favor a matching API (across languages) over language-idiomatic. Ths may chnage in the future, once I get good WASI bindings setup. We should try to use built-ins or sensible things for the language, for example, in nim we could use `echo` and `printf` in C.
- Feel free to wrap values however seems sensible for the language. Nim, for example, uses a overloaded `proc`s, so if you leave off the `destination` for image-functions (drawing, etc) it assumes `0` (screen)
- we can add things to the host, if the language just cannot do something, but you should try to do everything in the cart-header to adapt the language to it's host. For example, assemblyscript uses WTF16 encoding for strings, so we translate those to/from UTF8 null-terminated ("C strings") before interacting with the host.
