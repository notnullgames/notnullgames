- Get a programmer's editor. I like [zed](https://zed.dev/), but [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular choice.
- Choose from [our templates](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Acart+org%3Anotnullgames&type=Repositories). Pick a language you want to make your cart in.
- Press the "Use this template" button and create your own cart repo
- Do a search in your editor, in your project, for `mygame` and change it to whatever you want to call your game. I recommend names without "weird characters". Just use `A-z`, `0-9`, and `_`.

Optional: these carts include a few npm actions. To use them install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

- `npm start` - start a local web-server, and rebuild when your files change. This is great for trying out your ideas.
- `npm run build` - build your project and output to `webroot/mygame.null0`

I just use them as a way to record scripts in a cross-platform way (and allow use of libraries, etc.)

## ok, now what?

- See [API](/null0/api) for more info about the null0 API.
- See [Anatomy of a Cart](/null0/cart) to get a feel for what functions to expose to make your game, and how to use it.
- See [examples](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/)
