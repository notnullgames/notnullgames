  I have not setup docker or the node creator-script, so this is more like future-plans.

Check out [build.sh](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/blob/main/examples/build.sh) to see how I build all the examples on this site. It's a simplified shell-script approach.

### setup a new cart-project

You should have node/npm installed. We use that to make build-scripts & tooling.

```shell
npx create null0@latest
```

It will ask a few questions, and get you started.

Each language might require additional things installed (wasi-sdk, rust, nelua, nim, etc.)

### I don't want to intall anything

if you have docker, you can do the same stuff without installing anything else, and it even includes any build-requirements for all supported languages.

```shell
# common tasks
docker run -v ${PWD}:/cart -it konsumer/null0 create
docker run -v ${PWD}:/cart -it konsumer/null0 build

# run bash instead of the wrapper, and do whatever you like
docker run -v ${PWD}:/cart -it --entrypoint bash konsumer/null0
```
