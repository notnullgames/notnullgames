You should have node/npm installed. We use that to make build-scripts & tooling.

### setup a new cart-project

```shell
npx create null0@latest
```

It will ask a few questions, and get you started.

Each language might require additional things installed (wasi-sdk, rust, nelua, nim, etc.)

### I don't want to intall anything

if you have docker, you can do the same stuff without installing anything else, and it even includes any build-requirements for all supported languages.

```shell
# common tasks
docker run -v ${PWD}:/cart -it konsumer/null0 create
docker run -v ${PWD}:/cart -it konsumer/null0 build

# run bash instead of the wrapper, and do whatever you like
docker run -v ${PWD}:/cart -it --entrypoint bash konsumer/null0
```
