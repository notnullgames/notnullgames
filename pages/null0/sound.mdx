Sounds work like all types of sounds can be played with `play_sound` and there are several types.
</Callout>

Here is an example, click to focus for sound:

<Cart cart='/sound.null0' />

Source: [sound](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/tree/main/src/carts/sound)

The null0 zip-file looks like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ notnullgames.ogg
â””â”€â”€ main.wasm
```

Our docs aren't really ready, but we're working on it.

Here is the nim signatures for now:

```nim
# sound-source: load a sound file (ogg, wav, etc) from file inside the cart
proc load_sound(destination: uint32, filename: cstring)

# sound-source: create a text-to-speech talker
proc load_speech(destination: uint32, text: cstring)

# play a sound-source
proc play_sound(id: uint32)
```
