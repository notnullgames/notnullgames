<Callout emoji='ðŸ‘¾'>Games are called *carts* like *cartridges* for old console systems.</Callout>

A cart is made up of a few callbacks. You don't have to implement them all, but whatever you do implement will be called by the host. It's just a zip file, with `main.wasm` in the root. Use functions from the [null0 api](api) to make your game.

Here is one, now:

<Null0Cart src='/carts/js-flappy.null0' />
[source](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/js/flappy/)

All supported languages should have very simple/similar syntax.

You can find more examples [here](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples).

### lifecycle

```c
// called on load, you can also use main() in C
void load();

// called on every frame
void update();

// called when the cart is unloaded
void unload();
```

### input

#### keys

Button input is mapped using [libretro keys](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/input-and-controls/). If the event comes from a keyboard, `player` is set to `9999`. I think it helps to imagine all controllers are an SNES controller for most input-purposes, then you can use `buttonUp`/`buttonDown` for any player.

- D-pad: <kbd className="kbd mx-2">â–²</kbd><kbd className="kbd mr-2">â—€ï¸Ž</kbd><kbd className="kbd mr-2">â–¶ï¸Ž</kbd><kbd className="kbd">â–¼</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-yellow-300 text-black'>A</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>z</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-red-600 text-white'>B</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>x</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-green-600 text-white'>X</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>a</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-blue-600 text-white'>Y</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>s</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-stone-400 text-black'>L</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>q</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-stone-400 text-black'>R</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>w</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-stone-400 text-black'>SELECT</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>shift</kbd>
- <kbd className='kbd mr-2 bg-stone-400 text-black'>START</kbd>: <kbd className='kbd mr-2'>enter</kbd>

Here is an input-demo, that shows how the keys work:

<Null0Cart src='/carts/js-input.null0' />
[source](https://github.com/notnullgames/notnullgames/tree/main/examples/js/input/)

Here are the callbacks you can define:

```c
// mapped controller callback
void buttonUp(GamepadButton button, unsigned int player);

// mapped controller callback
void buttonDown(GamepadButton button, unsigned int player);

// called when keys are unpressed
void keyUp(Key key);

// called when keys are pressed
void keyDown(Key key);

// called when mouse-button is pressed
void mouseDown(unsigned int button);

// called when mouse-button is released
void mouseUp(unsigned int button);

// called when mouse is moved
void mouseMoved(float x, float y);

```

## running

If you want to run your cart natively, null0 CLI defaults to running `main.null0`, but you can also give it an argument:

```shell
null0 some_cart_directory
null0 some_cart.null0
```

### distribution

To distribute your game to others, you can either save your cart as main.null0, alongside the native runtime (and name the runtime whatever you want) or you can embed it all in one executable:

```sh
# linux or mac
cat build/host/null0 build/carts/input_c.null0 > tester

# windows
copy /b build/host/null0.exe+build/carts/input_c.null0 tester.exe
```

This is very similar to how [love2d works](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution).
