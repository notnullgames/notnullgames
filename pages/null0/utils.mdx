These are general utilities I was not sure where else to put in docs.

<Tabs items={['Nim', 'C/C++']}>
<Tab>
```nim
# log a string
trace("OK, this works.")

# log printf-style string
trace("OK, this works: %d", 15)
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```c
// log a string
trace("OK, this works.");

// log printf-style string
trace("OK, this works: %d", 15);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This may change to use WASI, so it will work however printing works in the target language (`printf` in C, `echo` in nim, etc.)
