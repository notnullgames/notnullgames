<Callout emoji={<img src='/logo.svg' className='h-10 w-10 !m-0' />}>Null0 is a fun & easy engine for making games that run in browser, and natively on any kind of computer, using any supported language.</Callout>

It's good for learning & playing.

Nullo games are called ["carts"](/null0/cart) which is just a zip-file with any assets + main.wasm that is needed to run your game. You can make that wasm in any language that supports that (quite a few.)
